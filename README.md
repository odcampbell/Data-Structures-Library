# Data-Structures-Library

When compiling with test files given by TA's, dont forget the
command line argument for which test to run!
There are 6 tests for each phase that you can run and theyre chosen via command line arguments.
If you forget the extra # (1-6) the program will not run successfully.

( We had to use a make file so the compilation is easy. After downloading the code and moving to the appropriate directory path
in your terminal, just type "make" into your terminal. )

e.g. 

make
Phase1 1

or 

make
Phase2 6
